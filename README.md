# Algorithmic Aesthetics : Recoding
A recoding of an algorithmic artwork (Untitled by Georg Nees, around 1964-1968)

## My pseudo-algorithm

* Make a rectangle that takes 100% of the width and length of the canvas
* Split the rectangle in two new rectangles, choose randomly lenghtwise OR widthwise. The width or length is randomly chosen, the two new rectangles should make 100% of the canvas width/length when added together.
* Split each new rectangle in two recursively lengthwise or widthwise until they reach a chosen minimum width or height
