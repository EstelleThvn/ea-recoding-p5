# Algorithmic Aesthetics : Recoding
A recoding of an algorithmic artwork (Untitled by Georg Nees, around 1964-1968)

## My pseudo-algorithm

Divide the canvas width in three rectangles with varying widths (it should make 100% of the canvas width when added together) and 100% canvas height
Divide the 3 rectangles in two rectangles with a random height for each one of them, and 100% width from the parent rectangle
For each rectangle : divide in two, choose lenghtwise OR widthwise
For each new rectangle : divide in two again
